# Medical-Image-Processing

Firstly, if you wish to get started with medical image processing, it is necessary to learn a machine learning language. Nowadays, the prevalent machine learning languages include TensorFlow, JAX, and Torch. We recommend Torch as your entry-level language here, due to its abundance of open-source projects and deployment tutorials.

Indeed, you do not need to learn every detail in Python and Torch; a general understanding of data manipulation therein is usually sufficient. You can refer to the API for queries as you use it moving forward.

Presently, medical image processing encompasses areas including segmentation, registration, molecular construction, and others. Here, we will provide a brief introduction to the content concerning segmentation. Current medical image segmentation falls generally into two major categories: optimization of medium and small-scale models based on directions such as UNet, SegFormer, and others. And another direction rooted in prompts based on the SAM model.

Firstly, the reference materials needed for the first direction are as follows (paper name and url):
