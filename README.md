# Medical-Image-Processing

Firstly, if you wish to get started with medical image processing, it is necessary to learn a machine learning language. Nowadays, the prevalent machine learning languages include TensorFlow, JAX, and Torch. We recommend Torch as your entry-level language here, due to its abundance of open-source projects and deployment tutorials.

Pytorch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDhBcP4ikpA&list=PLDzdzeKX7DWep2KyJwJ-BmYciXTARvZO6

Indeed, you do not need to learn every detail in Python and Torch; a general understanding of data manipulation therein is usually sufficient. You can refer to the API for queries as you use it moving forward.
